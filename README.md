<p align="center">Fast, responsive, self-hosted image gallery. Ships <strong>ZERO</strong> JavaScript to the client.</p>

[Mus√©e](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/mus%C3%A9e) (pronounced myu-zay) was written primarily to experiment around with https://remix.run/ but now re-written using https://astro.build. Until now I had been using the _excellent_ [`waschinski/photo-stream`](https://github.com/waschinski/photo-stream) gallery for hosting my images but felt limited with having to use Ruby. 

**Mission accomplished!** Mus√©e now ships **ZERO** client-side JavaScript while maintaining a responsive masonry layout with proper horizontal ordering. This is achieved through Astro's build-time static generation, pre-calculating column distributions for each breakpoint and using pure CSS for responsive display.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

Mus√©e achieves zero JavaScript by:

- Moving all date calculations to build time
- Using pure CSS animations instead of JavaScript libraries
