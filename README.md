<p align="center">Fast, responsive, self-hosted image gallery. Ships <strong>ZERO</strong> JavaScript to the client.</p>

[Musée](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/french-english/mus%C3%A9e) (pronounced myu-zay) was written primarily to experiment around with https://remix.run/ but now re-written using https://astro.build. Until now I had been using the _excellent_ [`waschinski/photo-stream`](https://github.com/waschinski/photo-stream) gallery for hosting my images but felt limited with having to use Ruby. 

**Mission accomplished!** Musée now ships **ZERO** client-side JavaScript while maintaining a responsive masonry layout with proper horizontal ordering. This is achieved through Astro's build-time static generation, pre-calculating column distributions for each breakpoint and using pure CSS for responsive display.

```

## 🚀 Deployment

Deployment (for now) is done to Cloudflare Pages. Documentation is available here: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/astro/

## 🏛️ Architecture

Musée achieves zero JavaScript by:
- Pre-calculating masonry column distributions at build time for each breakpoint
- Using CSS media queries to show/hide the appropriate pre-rendered layout
- Replacing React components with Astro components
- Moving all date calculations to build time
- Using pure CSS animations instead of JavaScript libraries
